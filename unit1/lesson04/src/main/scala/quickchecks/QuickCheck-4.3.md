Can you use the += operator with a var of type String? What about the operator -=?


ANSWER:

You can use the operator += together with a var of type String: you can reassign a variable, 
and the class String has an implementation for the function +. 
You cannot use the operator -=  with a var of type String because the class String doesn’t have a 
method called “-”.
